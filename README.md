# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Bluetooth&reg; Classic A2DP Source with AVRCP

This example demonstrates the functionality of Bluetooth&reg; Classic Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) Source and Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) on the CM33 project. It utilizes SBC (Low Complexity Subband Coding) encoding of audio data in the PSOC&trade; Edge MCU. 

In this example, CM33 retrieves raw PCM audio data from a raw WAV file stored in flash. The raw audio data is then encoded using SBC. The encoded data is sent to an external A2DP Sink device, such as a Bluetooth&reg; speaker, to play the pre-recorded audio stored in the PSOC&trade; Edge MCU.

This code example has a three-project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables the CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically and displays the CE title "PSOC EDGE MCU: A2DP Source + AVRCP".  It scans and lists Bluetooth&reg; A2DP sink devices, and prints their Bluetooth&reg; Device Addresses (BDAs) after loading the Bluetooth&reg; Stack and initializing the background tasks<br>
The blue LED (USER LED3) starts blinking to indicate that advertisement has started
    
    **Figure 1. Terminal output after scanning A2DP sink devices**
    ![](images/startup_btdevice_found.png)

5. Press the respective device number in the serial terminal. The device will connect and display the following output. The blue LED (USER LED3) stays ON indicating that the device has been connected
    
    **Figure 2. Terminal output after connecting to A2DP sink device**
    ![](images/terminal-a2dp-sink-device-connected-default.png)

6. If the desired device is not listed during the initial scan, press "y"/"Y" for rescanning
    
    **Figure 3. Terminal output after scanning, no A2DP sink devices listed**
    ![](images/startup_btdevice_notfound.png)

    > **Note:** If you are facing issues pairing with the A2DP sink device, press and hold the user button (SW2) and press the reset button (XRES) for clearing the bonding keys. Once the keys are cleared, it displays the following output. After resetting the bonding keys, reset the kit.
   
    **Figure 4. Terminal output after clearing bonding keys**

7. If the connection is successful, you can control the audio playback using A2DP sink device's (speaker or headphones) play/pause button and volume control buttons and it displays the output as per the following:

   **Figure 5. Terminal play/pause and volume control**
   ![](images/terminal-play-pause-volume-control.png)

   The following functions can be used in this example:

    - Press "Play/Pause" to play or pause the audio playback
    - Press volume "+" to increase the volume
    - Press volume "-" to decrease the volume

8. Pressing the user button (SW2) also controls the play/pause function of the playback
